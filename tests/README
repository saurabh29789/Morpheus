Tests for Morpheus
------------------

This is a collection of C++ exec written to test the different features of
the Morpheus library.
The test suite (would eventually) consists of:

1. Executables to verify each operator in isolation
2. Executables to verify operators working together
3. A single script to enable running of these tests and log the output
